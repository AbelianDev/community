    <h2>ABELIAN</h2>

    <p>Something happened to programming.</p>

    <p>
      Programming used to be about understanding the tools available,
      clearly defining what needed to be built, and carefully creating it
      while balancing tradeoffs. Each decision involved thought about
      security, readability, scalability, etc. It was challenging, yes, but it
      was also rewarding, engaging, and deeply human.
    </p>

    <p>
      But programming has changed. We've handed the core act of creation over
      to AI. Instead of using AI as a tool to handle repetitive tasks, we've
      let it take over the creative part itself. Delegating creative control
      to AI means we inevitably miss edge cases and important
      tradeoffs, details we'd naturally notice if we built the code ourselves.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now, developers spend their time reviewing AI-generated code,
      constantly checking and correcting rather than building. Humans aren’t
      wired for endless checking. We're at our best when we're solving
      problems, designing solutions, and thinking creatively.
    </p>

    <p>We believe programming should be about creating again.</p>

    <p>
      Meet Abelian, the IDE built for humans. Abelian lets AI handle the
      repetitive and tedious tasks, so you can reclaim your role as the
      thinker and creator. Abelian exists to help you code faster, with fewer
      distractions.

        Let’s get back to building.

      No fancy forms here. Just write “Hi, I’d love to try Abelian” to
      <strong>rei@abelian.dev</strong>, and I’ll send you early access personally.
